remote-camera
===

Example [electron](http://electron.atom.io/) app that creates a web server and then streams the remote web-cam of connected user to the local machine.

# Try it out!

Install and run the app:

```bash
$ npm install remote-camera -g
$ remote-camera
```

Now on another computed on the local network (or the same one if you want), navigate to the address displayed. 

After accepting the security prompt, the web cam will magically stream to the first computer!
